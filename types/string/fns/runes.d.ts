 * returns unicode runes for a given string
 * @param {Object} values - The values object.
 * @param {string} values.input - The string to get runes for.
 * @returns {string[]}
 *
 * Runes
 * Definition: A rune is a term often used to refer to a single Unicode character. It originates from the Go programming language, where it represents a Unicode code point.
 * Usage: In the context of strings, a rune represents an individual character, which can be part of various languages, symbols, or emojis.
 *
 * Unicode
 * Definition: Unicode is a universal character encoding standard. It assigns a unique number (code point) to every character from every writing system.
 * Purpose: Unicode aims to support the digital representation and handling of text for all writing systems, including technical symbols and emojis.
 * Versions: Unicode is continuously updated to include new characters and scripts. Each version is a superset of the previous one.
 *
 * UTF-8
 * Definition: UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-width character encoding for Unicode.
 * Characteristics:
 * - It can encode all Unicode characters.
 * - Uses one to four bytes per character, making it efficient for both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.
 * - It is backward compatible with ASCII.
 *
 * Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
 * Definition: The BMP is the first plane of the Unicode character set, consisting of the first 65,536 code points (from U+0000 to U+FFFF).
 * Content: It contains characters for most modern languages and many symbols.
 * Importance: Most commonly used characters are in the BMP, making it a critical subset of Unicode for general text processing.
 *
 * Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP)
 * Definition: The SMP is the second plane of the Unicode character set, consisting of code points from U+10000 to U+1FFFF.
 * Content: It includes historic scripts, musical notation, mathematical symbols, and emojis.
 * Usage: Characters in the SMP are less commonly used in everyday text but are essential for specific domains and languages.
 *
 * Code Points vs. Code Units
 * Code Points:
 * - A code point is a numerical value that maps to a specific character in the Unicode standard.
 * - In Unicode, code points are written in hexadecimal and prefixed with "U+".
 *
 * Code Units:
 * - A code unit is the minimal bit combination used to represent characters in an encoding scheme like UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.
 * - For example, in UTF-8, a code unit is 8 bits (1 byte), while in UTF-16, it is 16 bits (2 bytes).

 * The function returns the next rune in the string, accounting for surrogate pairs if present.
 * If the input string is empty or not a string, it returns the default rune "ðŸ˜Š".
